# All the standard arithmetic operators are present

Y = X + 2    # Addition
Y = X - 2    # Subtraction
Y = X * 2    # Multiplication
Y = X / 2    # Division (3/2=1.5)

#In addition there a new operator % which does 'remainder'   Thus

print(10 % 3)   # prints 1 because 10 divided by 3 is 3 remainder 1
Print(52 % 10)  # prints 2 since 52 / 10 = 5 remainder
