#It is not uncommon that you may want to test many mutually exclusive things.
#    For example lets assume we encode the day of the week as an integer where Monday = 0, Tuesday=1, â€¦ Sunday=6.
#      Given such a number we might wish to make a function that prints the day as a string.
#    This is where the 'elif' statement comes in.
#     With it we can write our day_of_the_week method as
